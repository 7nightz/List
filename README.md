READ THIS NOTE BEFORE YOU USE THIS LIST:

This list is intended mainly for chromebooks, but should still work on windows 10 laptops. 

You will be breaking your districts tech agreement when using these sites, however, games, apps, and proxies should NOT get you in trouble, the only thing that could get you some punishment is if you powerwash your chromebook (or enable dev mode) this entirely resets your chromebook and gets rid of every app on your device, as well as tuning down your devices security.

I am not liable for any punishment you get by using these sites, I am simply listing them so school can be a bit more enjoyable. 

(SIDE NOTE: Some games are pirated meaning you'll be technically breaking the law if you do decide on downloading them, however, most times you will not receive any punishment for this, yet you should still be cautious.)

DO NOT USE MAIN ACCOUNTS WHEN USING A PROXY, the owners can see your information and could possibly compromise your accounts, for this, use alternative accounts. 

It appears that some districts have disabled bookmarklets (bookmarks that can inject javascript), and so with that they have disabled injecting javacsript entirely, from the many I've tested, none of the injections seemed to work, they also disabled inspect element which means any methods you see about javascript is not going to function. 

I don't own the rights to any of these methods you will be using, I am just simply making them more accessible, and to give an update on what works and what doesn't so you don't go through this hassle for yourself.

Some methods require you to upload them to replit, for this you should create an account on replit. 

Some methods require you to download files, if you are uncomfortable with this or in concern for your data, then please, do not use them.

Do not gatekeep this list if you do find it, you are defeating the entire purpose of the research I've made.

Some methods are untested, meaning they may or may not work, if you'd like updates then visit my github repo: 

https://github.com/STREAM-YEAT/List (or if you're already reading it from github, welcome!) 

NOTE: Some districts may begin blocking github, but until that day all of these methods should remain working.

If you find this in the later future, I may not continue updating this site regularly so some methods may not work. 

NOTE: Schools have began to block certain terms and keywords immediately through GoGuardian, such terms include "Unblocked Games" "Proxies" "Proxy" "Unblocked Game" if a URL includes these the page will immediately get blocked.


10/14/22: Currently adding links to test later on.
